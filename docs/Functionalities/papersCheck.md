## Validate Functionality

By clicking on the "Validate" button, the plugin starts a task in MEOW that performs a set of checks on the papers' PDF files, which include:

- check on the size of the pages (width and height)
- check if the fonts of the paper are embedded

The result of the task is displayed in a modal that lists the PDF files that need to be checked, or none if no errors occur.

## Settings
