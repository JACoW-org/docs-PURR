This site hosts the documentation on how to use the [PURR](https://github.com/JACoW-org/PURR) plugin.

PURR is a plugin that is installed on JACoW's [Indico](https://getindico.io). It stands for "Proceedings Utility Running Remotely" and it includes all the functionalities that are needed to create a conference's final proceedings.

PURR works together with [MEOW](https://meow-docs.jacow.org/), which is located on a remote server. It is perfectly integrated in JACoW's ecosystem, as it uses the same entities and glossary.

When successfully connected with MEOW, there are four main functionalities exploited by PURR:

- Plugin connection status and settings management

- Abstract Booklet generation

- Papers Check

- Final Proceedings generation

<!-- The workflow follows the one well documented in the [Organizing IPACs (and other JACoW Events)](https://www.jacow.org/Editors/RunningJACoWConference)  hosted on the official [Joint Accelerator Conferences Website (JACoW)](https://www.JACoW.org).

As per the original document, the documentation is split in various chapters following 
the normal IPAC workflow (e.g., *Initial setup*, *Proposals for Invited Contributions*, *General abstract submission*, etc.).
However, an approach based on the *type of user* following the instructions has been chosen, as highlighted by the structure of the tree menu on the left.
